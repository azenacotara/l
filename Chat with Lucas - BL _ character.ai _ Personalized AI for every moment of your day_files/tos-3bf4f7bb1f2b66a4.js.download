Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Character.AI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\n**Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.** You and Character.AI agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Character.AI agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claims.\n\n**Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.** Character.AI is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and fairly, and so if you have concerns, we strongly encourage you to first contact us about them at [support.character.ai](https://support.character.ai/). If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Character.AI should be sent to: Character Technologies, Inc. #1152 700 El Camino Real Suite 120 Menlo Park CA 94025 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Character.AI and you do not resolve the claim within 60 calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Character.AI may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Character.AI or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Character.AI is entitled.\n\n**Arbitration Procedures.** Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on JAMS, please visit its website, https://www.jamsadr.com. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the JAMS Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\n\nUnless Character.AI and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco, CA. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by JAMS. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Character.AI agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\n\n**Costs of Arbitration.** Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.\n\n**Confidentiality.** All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.\n\n**Severability.** If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.\n\n**Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement.** Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Character.AI agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Character.AI written notice within thirty 30 calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
